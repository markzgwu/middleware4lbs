//Problem B: Hilbert Curve Intersections

hilbert.java

problem:  given integers n, x1, x2, y,
find the number of times the segment from (x1/2^n, y/2^n) to (x2/2^n, y/2^n)
intersects H(n), the nth approximation to the Hilbert curve.
Assume x1 < x2, 0 < n < 31.  Each of x1, x2, and y lie in [0, 2^n].
Input terminates when n is 0.

An O(n) dynamic programming algorithm:

Though the problem is stated for horizontal segments, in the recursive
solution involving rotated regions, both horizontal and vertical segments
need to be considered.

To keep all number as integers as in the input data, modify the nth Hilbert
curve H(n) to lie in [0, 2^n] X [0, 2^n], so the transformations from H(n) to
H(n-1) only rotate, reflect and translate, but do not scale, and x1, x2, and y
are coordinates without any further scaling.

There are a few simple special cases:  Segments that go up the edges, at 0 or
2^n, cross no segments of H(n).  Segments that go up or across the middle,
cross at most two of the three linking segments, and these checks can be done
directly.  These cases take care of any segment in H(1).

For segments other than the special cases above, in a higher iterate H(n), we
use the recursive definition:  If the segment lies totally within one of the
four quadrants of the square, its crossing count is the same as for its
transformation into H(n-1).  Other segments cross the midline, and can be split
into two pieces in two different quadrants, and both can be reduced to segments
in H(n-1).  The sums are counted recursively in the method crossings, but to
keep the time from being exponential in n, use a standard dynamic programming
table.  In fact the count for no more than 6n different segments need to be
calculated.

Consider segments in two catagories:  those that go all the way across a curve,
and those that go only part way.  At all steps in reducing segments to the
previous Hilbert iterate, there is only one time that a segment can be split into
two segments, neither going all the way across:  the first time it crossses the
middle.  After that, if there is a further split, one piece goes all the way
across its half.  Hence there are no more than 2n segments that do not go all the
way across.  Finally we note that the number of distinct segments needed that go
all the way across a curve is no more that 4n:

Consider a horizontal segment, and imagine all the square regions in H(n) where
there are transformations of H(j) that intersect the segment.  The segment is at
the same distance up from the bottom of each of these smaller squares.  Some
squares involve rotation and reflection, however, so if all these transformations
of H(j) along this line in H(n) were mapped back to H(j), along with the segment
through them, all the segments would end up in one of four positions, each same
distance from an edge.  For all H(j), 1 <= j <= n, this no more than 4n segments.

The Seg class represents a segment and the Hilbert iterate it is associated with.
To keep track of Seg keys for a Hashtable, we must override hashCode and
equals for the Seg class.
